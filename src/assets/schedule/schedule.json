      "topic": "Accelerating the Future of Java",
      "abstract": "As one of the most pervasively used technologies in our lifetime, Java continues to innovate the application world around us. Through continued modernization Java offers developers a contemporary language and platform to create the next generation of rich, scalable, and secure enterprise applications. And as the technology landscape changes around us, often times at an ever-more increasing pace, Java is primed to offer developers continued uniqueness to address new-found opportunities. Hear from Georges Saab (VP, Java Platform Group and OpenJDK Chairperson) to learn how Oracle is continuing to steward ongoing Java technology enhancements by covering the Java release process, OpenJDK, Oracle JDK, and how licensing will affect companies.",

      "topic": "Launching the Micro Future: Groovy, Grails, and Micronaut",
      "abstract": "<p>In this talk, Jeff Brown will demonstrate how the future of Grails, GORM, and Micronaut are linked, as well as how the OCI Groovy and Grails team is taking productivity around developing microservices to the next level!</p><p>Micronaut is a new JVM-based, full-stack framework for building modular, easily testable microservice applications. Unlike reflection-based IoC frameworks, which load and cache reflection data for every single field, method, and constructor in your code, with Micronaut, your application startup time and memory consumption are not bound to the size of your codebase.</p><p>The Micronaut framework shares many core values with Grails, including the enablement of code simplicity and developer productivity. Micronaut offers many additional features for a new class of applications (e.g., microservices, serverless deployments, etc.) that may not be well-suited for Grails.</p> <p>Compelling aspects of the Micronaut framework include: <ul> <li> Sub-second startup time <li> Tiny processes that may run in as little as 8mb of heap <li> No runtime reflection <li> Dependency injection <li> Load balancing <li> And more! </ul></p>",

He has been doing JVM application development for as long as the JVM has existed. He has spent most of the last decade focused specifically on work related to the Grails framework, is a key contributor to the frameworksâ€™ core development, and recently co-founded the Micronaut framework.</p><p>You can find Jeff on Twitter @jeffscottbrown (<a href='https://twitter.com/jeffscottbrown' target='_blank'>https://twitter.com/jeffscottbrown</a>)</p>"
