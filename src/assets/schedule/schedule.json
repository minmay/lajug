      "abstract": "<p>Software Engineers are more often required to use and design relational database.</p><p>I have worked at a few places that designed and managed their relational database correctly. I have also worked at several places that seemed problematic in how they designed, used, or managed their relational database system.<p/><p>I will pass on what I have learned from these experiences to help developers, and organizations improve their database design.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>\"It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.\" -W. Edwards Deming<p/>.<p>Work takes time to flow through an organization and ultimately be deployed to production where it captures value. It’s critical to reduce time-to-production. Software - for many organizations and industries - is a competitive advantage. Organizations break their larger software ambitions into smaller, independently deployable, feature -centric batches of work - microservices. In order to reduce the round-trip between stations of work, organizations collapse or consolidate as much of them as possible and automate the rest; developers and operations beget \"devops,\" cloud-based services and platforms (like Cloud Foundry) automate operations work and break down the need for ITIL tickets and change management boards. But velocity, for velocity’s sake, is dangerous. Microservices invite architectural complexity that few are prepared to address. In this talk, we’ll look at how high performance organizations like Ticketmaster, Alibaba, and Netflix make short work of that complexity with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Making it to production quickly is a noble goal. You will quickly need to make many decisions on your way there, and also adapt. The agile movement lead to the creation of many agile frameworks. If you are a Java developer, and you used Spring, you probably created plenty of technical debt in your attempt to integrate many different technologies. However, Spring Boot now makes many of the decisions for you, and as a result, helps you get to production more quickly.</p><p>This presentation will introduce Spring Boot. In the first half of the meeting, I will explain Inversion of Control, and provide an overview of the features in Spring Boot. In the second half of the presentation, I will build simple applications that integrate technologies from the whole kitchen, including the sink.<p/>",
